# Airline-Reservation-System
An early CS3520 project made with a fellow classmate. <br /> 
User is able to view the airplane manifest, view seats availability, choose a seat to sit in, remove a person, and change seats. <br /> 
System has state permanence and can save which seats are available and load previous saves by reading text files.
